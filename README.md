# SusiWars

This is a sinatra(ruby) application, which uses info from SUSI (Sofia University system) to
log in. It should be a simple quiz game, similar to the FMI christmas quiz.
It is in initial state and through now only a chat is implemented.

## Installation (not sure if it is really needed)

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'SusiWars'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install SusiWars

## Usage

Go to terminal and change directory to the project's lib folder.
Type:

    $ruby SusiWars.rb

for now you can only enjoy chatting with other users and login/logout :D.
